&par Example Description

The program aims to show how to DMA or polling mode to write and read SD card data by SDIO.
In this case, the application will mount the file system in SD Card. If there is no the file
System, you can Press KEY1(PF9) twice to creat a file system which could make you data lost.
When the file system is mounted success, you can press KEY1, KEY2 and KEY3 to operation the
file system.

The status of SD card can be displayed using serial assistant.
KEY1 KEY2 and KEY3 can be used as :
1. Press KEY1(PF9)  ----> Scan the files of the file system.
2. Press KEY2(PC13) ----> Write a file to file system.
3. Press KEY3(PA0)  ----> Delete the file from file system.

notes:
It is best to use SD card V2.0 to test.
