&par Example Description

This example shows how to use RTC Peripheral to make a clock. After power on,
program will read the backup area data to determine whether to reconfigure RTC
time. Then the RTC time will display in the LCD and written to the backup area.

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

&par Hardware Description

  - Load CR1220 lithium battery
  - Close J7 VBAT jumper to MCU VBAT pin

&par Directory contents

  - RTC/RTC_Clock/Source/apm32e10x_int.c     Interrupt handlers
