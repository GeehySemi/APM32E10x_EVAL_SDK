&par Example Description

This example shows how to use I2C Peripheral to read and write EEPROM.
Press KEY1 to write data to EEPROM and read data form EEPROM. If read and
write success, LED2 will turn on.  The data will be shown on serial assistant
trough usart1. If error, LED3 will turn on. And LCD will display the test information.

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

&par Hardware Description

  - Config I2C1
  - EEPROM I2C SCL PIN  PB6
  - EEPROM I2C SDA PIN  PB7
