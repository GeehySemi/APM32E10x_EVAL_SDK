&par Example Description

This example shows how to use ADC Peripheral to detect potentiometer.
Press KEY1 to start test. If detect operation is success, LCD will display
the test information.

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
