&par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN1 and CAN2 peripherals to send and
receive CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control LCD by
pressing KEY1 or KEY2 push buttons:
  - When KEY1 button is pressed, CAN1 sends a message to CAN2.
  - When KEY2 button is pressed, CAN2 sends a message to CAN1.

notes:
For this example, the board must be powered with 5V.

The CAN connection as follows:

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
