&par Example Description 

The program aims to show how to use DMC to read and write data to external SDRAM.
The test results will be displayed on the LCD screen, and printed by USART1.

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
